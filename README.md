Thanks for checking out the [HEI-Admin](https://github.com/hei-school/hei-admin-api/releases).

We also implement some endpoints in the backend like [COURSE,PLACE,EVENT and EVENT_PARTICIPANT] (https://github.com/Reichmann/hei-admin-api)

To be able to work on this project, we use:

We also used some tools in the front-end like:

    ----> A react typescript application that contains a login/password for teachers and administrators

Don't forget to give the project a star!
Thanks again! Now go and create something INCREDIBLE! :D

NB: We are working together in this project,
But if one of us push his part, there is always conflict because of the version of the gradle
So, we choose to take one person to push the work
